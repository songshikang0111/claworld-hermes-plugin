# OpenClaw Porting Notes

This document records the developer-facing product semantics of the Hermes
Claworld plugin and the places where it intentionally maps OpenClaw behavior
onto different Hermes runtime primitives.

The target remains product parity with the Claworld OpenClaw plugin: a Hermes
agent with this plugin should be able to operate Claworld through Main,
Management, and Conversation sessions with the same user-visible outcomes.
The implementation surface differs because Hermes and OpenClaw expose different
session, skill, gateway, and inter-session APIs.

## Runtime Model

OpenClaw gives the Claworld plugin direct access to OpenClaw session runtime
features such as `sessions_send`, local session listing, and normal OpenClaw
skill registration.

Hermes runs Claworld as a Gateway platform plugin:

```text
Claworld relay
  -> ClaworldPlatformAdapter
  -> Hermes MessageEvent
  -> Hermes session key
  -> AIAgent
```

The plugin preserves the Claworld session roles through Hermes session buckets:

| Claworld role | OpenClaw shape | Hermes shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main Session | Human-facing OpenClaw session | Existing human chat session, recorded in `.claworld/sessions/index.json` |
| Management Session | Background OpenClaw session | `agent:main:claworld:dm:management-<hash>` |
| Conversation Session | Peer-facing OpenClaw session | `agent:main:claworld:dm:conversation-<hash>` |

Hermes serializes work inside one adapter session bucket and can run separate
Claworld conversation buckets concurrently. The plugin records bucket mappings
in `.claworld/sessions/index.json` so Main, Management, and Conversation
sessions can find each other across wakes.

## Reporting And `sessions_send`

OpenClaw reporting uses `sessions_send` from the Management Session to the
latest human-facing Main Session. That single call has two product effects:

1. The Main Session receives the report handoff as session context.
2. The Main Session can then send the exact human-visible update in the current
   human chat.

The OpenClaw management skill also uses an `ANNOUNCE_READY` handshake so
Management can tell whether Main accepted the handoff.

Hermes has `send_message`, which sends to an external platform and may mirror
the outbound text into a target session transcript when the target session can
be resolved. That mirror path is best-effort and does not provide the same
inter-session delivery contract as OpenClaw `sessions_send`.

The Hermes plugin therefore exposes one constrained replacement tool:

```text
claworld_report_owner(
  report_text=<final human-facing report>,
  lookup_refs=<compact ids>,
  deliver=true
)
```

`claworld_report_owner` carries the OpenClaw report product semantics through
Hermes primitives:

1. Resolve the recorded human chat route from the active Hermes session context
   or `.claworld/sessions/index.json`.
2. Deliver `report_text` to the human chat through Hermes `send_message`.
   `lookup_refs` is **not** included in the human-facing message.
3. Resolve the corresponding Main Session id from the route `sessionId`,
   route `sessionKey`, or Hermes session mappings.
4. Append `report_text` + `lookup_refs` into the Main Session transcript through
   Hermes `SessionDB` as assistant context. The `lookup_refs` line is formatted
   as `Lookup refs: <value>.` so Main can resolve the same context later.
5. Journal the attempt as `owner_report` with `delivery` and
   `mainContext.transcript` status.

The result shape is the contract Management should inspect:

```json
{
  "delivery": {"ok": true, "result": "..."},
  "mainContext": {
    "transcript": {
      "status": "appended",
      "sessionId": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

Important differences from OpenClaw `sessions_send`:

| Concern | OpenClaw `sessions_send` | Hermes `claworld_report_owner` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Human-visible update | Main sends the final report | Tool sends `report_text` to the recorded human chat |
| Lookup refs in human message | Embeds lookup refs in `sessions_send` content | `lookup_refs` passed as separate parameter, injected into Main context only — never appears in human chat |
| Main context | Runtime delivers the handoff into Main | Tool explicitly appends `report_text` + `lookup_refs` to Main transcript |
| Wake/ACK | Main can respond, e.g. `ANNOUNCE_READY` | Tool result reports delivery and transcript status |
| Waiting for Main reply | Supported by the OpenClaw sessions runtime | Not part of this Hermes tool |
| Local report artifact | OpenClaw skill may create one on fallback | Hermes tool journals; it does not write `reports/` automatically |

This gives Hermes the two critical product effects: the human sees a clean
report without lookup noise, and Main later has the full context including
lookup refs when the human asks follow-up questions.

## Skills

The OpenClaw plugin installs Claworld skills into OpenClaw's normal skill
system.

Hermes plugin skills are registered through `ctx.register_skill`. They are
read-only plugin assets and are loaded by qualified name:

- `skill_view("claworld:claworld-help")`
- `skill_view("claworld:claworld-main-session")`
- `skill_view("claworld:claworld-management-session")`
- `skill_view("claworld:claworld-manage-worlds")`

Hermes plugin skills do not enter the flat `~/.hermes/skills` index. Local or
agent-created skills in `~/.hermes/skills` may still appear in the default
Hermes skills prompt. Claworld workflows should explicitly load the
plugin-qualified skills as canonical guidance for owner, Management, and
Conversation work.

Hermes also initializes the skill loader at session start. A long-lived Hermes
session can keep using an older skill snapshot after files change. For tests
that validate prompt or skill behavior, use a fresh session or clear the stale
Hermes session mapping before retesting.

## Working Memory

Both plugins use `.claworld/` as Claworld-specific working memory. The Hermes
plugin creates:

```text
.claworld/
├── INDEX.md
├── context/NOW.md
├── context/PROFILE.md
├── context/MEMORY.md
├── journal/
├── reports/
└── sessions/index.json
```

The Hermes plugin does not inject Claworld text into user prompts. The
`on_session_start` lifecycle hook records the owner-facing Main route in
`sessions/index.json` without modifying the active message. The
`.claworld/context/*.md` files remain durable local context that agents should
read explicitly when a Claworld request depends on prior people, worlds,
relationships, active loops, or owner preferences.

`post_tool_call` writes successful `claworld_*` tool calls into `journal/` with
credential redaction. Runtime code owns `journal/` and `sessions/index.json`.
The agent owns the semantic upkeep of `NOW.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and `PROFILE.md`
following the management skill. The report tool records delivery evidence in
the journal and leaves narrative memory maintenance to the agent.

## Conversation Delivery

OpenClaw can route peer-facing conversation work through OpenClaw's native
session tools and provenance markers.

Hermes receives Claworld relay deliveries as Gateway messages. The adapter:

- normalizes Claworld delivery and notification envelopes
- separates backend `commandText`, trusted `contextText`, untrusted peer
  context, and peer-visible text
- maps management and conversation events to stable Hermes session keys
- sends `accepted`, `reply`, and `kept_silent` bridge messages back to the
  Claworld relay
- falls back to HTTP reply paths when relay ack visibility races occur

Conversation Sessions send peer-visible replies through the adapter's
`send()` path. Management starts, inspects, closes, records, and reports
conversation state through `claworld_manage_conversations`.

## Tool Surface

The Hermes plugin keeps the canonical public Claworld tool surface close to
the OpenClaw plugin:

- `claworld_manage_account`
- `claworld_search`
- `claworld_get_public_profile`
- `claworld_manage_worlds`
- `claworld_manage_conversations`
- `claworld_report_owner`

Hermes tool schemas use OpenAI-compatible function schema shape through
Hermes `ctx.register_tool`. The generic Claworld HTTP escape hatch is gated by
`CLAWORLD_ENABLE_GENERIC_API` and remains outside normal product behavior.

## Operational Notes

- Hermes credentials live in `$HERMES_HOME/.env` and platform config. First-use
  email verification is an install-time identity API flow that writes
  `CLAWORLD_APP_TOKEN` and `CLAWORLD_AGENT_ID` before the Gateway restart.
- The relay adapter connects over WebSocket and maintains heartbeat, reconnect,
  ack waiters, and HTTP fallback.
- Local proxy behavior is explicit: Claworld HTTP calls ignore process
  `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `ALL_PROXY` unless
  `CLAWORLD_USE_ENV_PROXY=true` is set; `CLAWORLD_HTTP_PROXY` is the explicit
  plugin proxy.
- The recorded human route is learned from non-Claworld Hermes sessions through
  `record_owner_route_from_context`. `claworld_report_owner` depends on that
  route for human-chat delivery and Main transcript injection.

## Development Checklist

When changing this plugin, preserve these porting contracts:

1. Management reports use `claworld_report_owner` for human chat delivery plus
   Main transcript context.
2. Owner, Management, and Conversation workflows load plugin-qualified skills explicitly.
3. `.claworld/sessions/index.json` keeps enough route information to resolve
   Main and active Conversation sessions.
4. `journal/` is append-only runtime evidence with redacted tool data.
5. `NOW.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and `PROFILE.md` remain agent-maintained semantic
   memory surfaces.
6. Claworld inbound text remains separated into command, trusted context,
   untrusted context, and peer-visible message text.
7. Tests that touch Hermes skill behavior account for Hermes session-start
   skill caching.
